## Usage & Liability

These materials are provided to **students I tutor** as **reference examples only**.  
They are meant to **illustrate concepts** or **show possible approaches** — not to be copied or submitted as original work.  

- The examples may not represent full or correct solutions.  
- You’re encouraged to use them for **study, comparison, and learning**, not submission.  
- If you copy or misuse this work and face academic or disciplinary consequences, **you are solely responsible**.

Use this repo to learn, not to cheat yourself out of understanding.

## How to Use These Examples to Learn

This repository exists to **help you understand how to think through programming problems**, not to give you a finished answer.  
Here’s how I recommend you use each example:

1. **Try solving the problem on your own first.**  
   Write your own code *without* looking at mine. Even if it doesn’t work, this step helps you build problem-solving habits.

2. **If you get stuck, use my example as a reference — not a template.**  
   Look at the logic, compare it with yours, and note where your approach differs.  
   For instance, in the [`scoreboard.java`](https://github.com/Hosanna13/ACE-Examples/blob/main/11.3%20Scoreboard%20Example%20-%20Intro%20to%20Java/scoreboard.java) example, you could create a **tracing table** to understand how the program finds the maximum score.

3. **Experiment and modify.**  
   Refactor logic to make the code your own.
   The goal is to learn how to think like a developer, not just copy syntax.

5. **Ask questions.**  
   If something confuses you, bring it up in tutoring sessions. I’d rather explain the *why* behind the code than have you memorize it.

### Important Note

If it comes to my attention that students are **copying and pasting code** from this repository for assignments or submissions,  
I will **remove this repository entirely**. These examples are meant to support your growth — not replace your work.  

Use this responsibly, and you’ll actually get better at coding.
